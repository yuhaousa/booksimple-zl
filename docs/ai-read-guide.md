# AI-Powered Read Guide Feature

## Overview

The Read Guide feature now uses OpenAI GPT-4 to generate comprehensive, dynamic content for each book instead of using hardcoded information. This provides personalized and detailed reading guides that are specific to each book in your library.

## Features

### Dynamic AI Content Generation
- **Comprehensive Summaries**: 300-500 word detailed summaries tailored to each book
- **Author Background**: Detailed information about the book's author, including education, career, and achievements
- **Book Background**: Context about the book's creation, historical background, and publication impact
- **World Relevance**: Analysis of the book's significance in today's world and modern applications
- **Key Points**: 6 specific, actionable insights extracted from the book
- **Keywords & Topics**: Relevant keywords and main topic areas covered
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Topic-specific quiz questions with explanations

### Smart Caching System
- AI analysis results are cached to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Content is regenerated only when needed or manually requested
- Cached content is personalized per user

### Fallback Content
- Comprehensive fallback content ensures the feature works even without AI
- Seamless transition between AI-generated and fallback content
- Clear indicators show content source (AI vs. Fallback)

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Analysis**: When you visit a book's Read Guide, the system first checks for cached AI analysis
2. **AI Generation**: If no cached content exists, the system uses OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze the book
3. **Content Display**: The generated content is displayed with clear indicators of the source
4. **Manual Regeneration**: You can manually regenerate AI content using the "Regenerate AI" button
