# Login Tracking Setup

This document explains how to set up login tracking for the BookSimple application.

## Database Setup

1. **Run the SQL script** to create the login tracking infrastructure:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the contents of scripts/create-login-tracking.sql in your Supabase SQL editor
   ```

2. **The script creates:**
   - `login_tracking` table to store individual login events
   - `user_login_stats` view to aggregate login statistics
   - `record_login()` function to safely record login events
   - Appropriate indexes and RLS policies

## Features Added

### Admin Users Table
The admin users table now includes:
- **Last Login Date & Time**: Shows when the user last logged in
- **Total Login Count**: Total number of login sessions
- **First Login Date**: When the user first logged in
- **Enhanced layout**: Separate columns for better readability

### Login Tracking
- **Automatic tracking**: Every successful login is recorded
- **Session information**: Captures user agent and session ID
- **Fallback handling**: Works even if tracking tables don't exist yet
- **Non-blocking**: Login tracking errors don't prevent login

## Usage

1. **For existing applications**: Login tracking will start working immediately after database setup
2. **For new users**: All login statistics will be tracked from their first login
3. **Admin view**: Go to `/admin/users` to see comprehensive user login statistics

## Data Collected

- User ID (linked to auth.users)
- Login timestamp
- User agent (browser/device info)
- Session ID (for debugging)
- IP address (if available)

## Privacy & Security

- All login data is linked to authenticated users only
- RLS policies ensure users can only see their own login records
- Admin access can be controlled via Supabase auth policies
- No sensitive data (passwords, etc.) is stored in tracking

## Troubleshooting

If login tracking doesn't work:
1. Check if the SQL script was executed successfully
2. Verify RLS policies allow the operations
3. Check browser console for any tracking errors
4. Login will still work even if tracking fails
